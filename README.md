# SignalRChat
<h3>This was a prototype testing repository I used when developing and learning SignalR to create the live chat feature in the WPF application</h3>
<p>The chat uses MVVM and very basic UI, the main goal was to learn and understand the SignalR data pipeline for sending and receiving objects in real time.
